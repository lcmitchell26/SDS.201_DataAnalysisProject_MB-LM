# Hollywood vs. The Bechdel Test

## Introduction
● Explains the nature of the data you are analyzing in sufficient detail

Hollywood's long history of sexism now faces the blatent truths that
only statistics can make perfectly clear. The Bechdel Test, designed to
measures representaiton of women in film and other fictional media, is
responsible for revealing the representation and monitary inequities of
the industry. For a movie to pass the test it must feature two female
characters who have converstations about a topic other than men. With
data from #\_\_ movies we uncover the extent of the dilhema illustrated
below.

● Explains what analyses are performed and what can be learned from them

Our data analysis has reason to consider the numeric variable of budget
and categorical Pass/Fail due to \_\_ discrimination. We prose the
question "Do movies that pass the Bechdel Test have a higher budget?".
If this is true our hypothesis would reveal that these variables are
related to one another and that movies with lower budgets fail the
bechdel test. The numerica variable Budget serves as the outcome
variable in our analysis while the categorical variable to Pass or Fail
Bechdel Test rpovides the explanatory variable of the analysis. To test
this method we will use a regression model with a permutation test to
show \_\_.

● Ends with overall conclusions related to your research question that
are supported by your data analysis.

##### Null Hypothesis: There is no difference in the average budget of movies that pass or fail the Bechdel test. 
$$
\mu_{Pass} - \mu_{Fai} = 0
$$

##### Alternative Hypothesis: There is a difference in the average budget of movies that pass or fail the Bechdel test.
$$
\mu_{Pass} - \mu_{Fail} \ne 0
$$
#### Raw Data
```{r}
#| echo: false 
movies_raw <- read_sheet("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12xXTpjqwY35HV5WcAZtIGxnLc8xmBD0hQPVZKR5njcY/edit?gid=1554984819#gid=1554984819")

movies_raw <- slice(movies_raw, 1:3) 
kable(movies_raw) 
```
##### Data for Analysis 
```{r}
#| echo: false 
movies <- movies_raw |>
  select(title, binary, budget)

movies <- slice(movies, 1:8)
kable(movies)
```
